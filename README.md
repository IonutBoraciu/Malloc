# Malloc implementation
  
  * Implemented custom malloc
and calloc using sbrk and nmap
for dynamic memory allocation.

  * Features: Managed memory
with linked lists, reducing
fragmentation via
splitting/merging.

  * Achived: simulating a memory
allocator and improved low-
level memory management
understanding.
